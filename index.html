    <h2>Information about the game</h2>
    <p>Simon, the electronic marvel of memory and skill, sprang from the creative minds of Ralph H. Baer and Howard J. Morrison, under the banner of toy design firm Marvin Glass and Associates. With the wizardry of software programming by Lenny Cope, Simon captivated players with its symphony of tones and lights, challenging them to recall and repeat its ever-growing sequences.</p>
    <p>As players mastered each level, Simon upped the ante, pushing their memory to new heights with longer and more complex sequences. However, a single misstep or the merciless march of time spelled the end of the game.</p>
    <p>Originally brought to life by Milton Bradley and later under the banner of Hasbro, Simon's inner workings were masterfully crafted by Charles Kapps, a pioneer in computer science at Temple University. His expertise, coupled with a keen insight into the theory of computer programming, laid the foundation for Simon's intricate assembly language code.</p>
    <p>In 1978, Simon made its dazzling debut at Studio 54 in New York City. Its instant success transformed it into a pop culture icon of the vibrant 1970s and 1980s, etching itself into the hearts and minds of a generation.</p>
